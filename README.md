This is a small qualification task which was done by me as a part of qualification for GSoC 2023. The plan was to develop a training centre website for HSF-Training Centre. 
I was provided with a yaml file, which was a database of all the learning modules available on the Training Centre Website.
The final plan was to add filters on the YAML file, based on various fields present in it.
It was built using Gatsby Cloud. Implementation of filters was successfully done on two of the paramenters.

This was done in extremely short duration, and hence, the project wasn't realised completely. It is still left to be completed.
